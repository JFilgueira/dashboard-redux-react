# Dashboard with User Role Management with Redux Toolkit and React.js

## Project's Scope
Much more than implementing something with Redux, I wanted, in this project, to simply learn the basics of Redux. The idea came from a friend: "Don't use Redux to create another Todo-list. Make something more real-world scenario." So, despite the simplicity of the app, you will be able to choose a user role, and based on that, you're going to have access or not to some parts of the site. The greater the role, the greater the access. And all of that data management is handled by Redux Toolkit.

* Choose a user role and navigate through different parts of the site
* Create new posts with Editor or higher access
* Delete users from a user list with Admin access
* Responsive design
* Protected routes

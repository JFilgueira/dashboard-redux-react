# Dashboard with User Role Management with Redux Toolkit and React.js

## Project's Scope
Much more than implement something with Redux, I wanted in this project to simply learn the basics of Redux. The ideia came by friend, "don't use redux to create another Todo-list. Make something more real-world sceanario". So despite the simplicity of the app, you will be able to choose a user role and based on that you're going to have acess or not to some parts of the site. The greater the role, the grater the acess. And of that data management made by Redux Toolkit.

* Choose a user role and navigate through different parts of the site
* Create new posts when having a Editor or higher acess
* Delete users from a user list when Admin acess
* Responsive design
* Protected routes
